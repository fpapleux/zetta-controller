Apigee Zetta driver, scout and app for a system controller. This is early exploration in Zetta. I want to create an object that can allow administrators to operate the system from the console when appropriate. Not sure if that is of any value at this point. But, for instance, I think it would be nice to have a log object that could do its own thing and that all objects connected to the Zetta server could leverage for logging...
